# Astronauts vs Aliens

## Browser modernization

The playable TypeScript/Phaser edition lives in [`web/`](web/README.md). **Expedition 0.7** improves opening Campaign discovery, mode labels, replay/next-mission guidance, accessible credit totals and outcome feedback. The existing six-mission campaign, three original standalone destinations, nine defenders and six alien types remain intact. A 1,080-run pacing study and 36 frozen-engine parity runs support retaining current combat balance. See the [0.7 report](web/docs/EXPEDITION_0_7.md) and [campaign architecture](web/docs/CAMPAIGN_ARCHITECTURE.md). Native desktop Safari now has an earned-credit victory/reload check; independent players, physical phones and live screen readers remain outstanding. Original school source/assets and history remain preserved. Hosting is separate.

```sh
cd web
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Run `npm run check` inside `web/` for simulation tests, TypeScript checking, and a production build. See the [browser README](web/README.md) for browser tests and hosting details.

Active browser development uses **`modernization`**. The original school version is preserved by the annotated **[`school-project-2019`](https://github.com/tr3ylbry/TowerDefense/tree/school-project-2019)** tag and the **`master`** comparison branch. Original Java source and assets remain intact.

This is Trey Bryant's independent continuation of the team project below. Original author credits are retained. [Asset provenance notes](web/ASSET_CREDITS.md) distinguish the retained school artwork from new browser work.

## Original Java edition

This is a tower defense game with a gameplay similar to Plants vs Zombies. The main objective is to survive the attack of the aliens by generating income and placing astronauts to destroy the aliens.
